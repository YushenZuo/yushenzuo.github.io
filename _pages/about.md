<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am Yushen Zuo, currently a research assistant at <a href='https://www.polyu.edu.hk/'>The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)</a>, working under the guidance of <a href='https://www.eie.polyu.edu.hk/~enkmlam/'>Prof. Kenneth K. M. Lam</a> and in close collaboration with <a href='https://junxiao01.github.io/'>Jun Xiao</a>.

Prior to this, I was an Applied Scientist at <a href='https://www.microsoft.com/en-us'>Microsoft</a>. Before that, I was interned at <a href='https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/'>Microsoft Research Asia</a> and <a href='https://github.com/TencentYoutuResearch'>Tencent Youtu Lab</a>. I hold a master's degree from <a href='https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/'>Tsinghua University</a> and a bachelor's degree from <a href='https://en.xidian.edu.cn/'>Xidian University</a>. 

I am actively seeking PhD opportunities worldwide. My research areas include low-level vision; image translation and generation; object detection and segmentation; vision-language model safety. 

Here is my <a href="cv/Yushen_CV_Oct2024.pdf">**CV**</a>.

    - Explainable AI
      - Use SHAP to calculate feature contribution to ranking score for a better explanation of model's output.
      - Show users why he/she sees this recommended content based on the recall path with a mapping method.
      - Currently applied to all Bing News channels (e.g. Edge homepage), while collecting user's feedback to modify the mapping method.-
    - Dynamic quota allocation
      - Train a classification model to determine whether a news recommendation request is triggered by user or by prerender/other backend tasks based on request's features and the corresponding user's engagement features. (Result: AUC > 0.8 in test dataset built on Bing News Recommendation database)
      - Based on the result of classification model, reduce the quota of each recall path in Ranker for requests predicted to be `Not User-trigger' to reduce computational cost.
      - Product performance: Reduce 20% computing resources usage without losing performance.
