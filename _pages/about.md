    - Dynamic quota allocation
      - Train a classification model to determine whether a news recommendation request is triggered by user or by prerender/other backend tasks based on request's features and the corresponding user's engagement features. (Result: AUC > 0.8 in test dataset built on Bing News Recommendation database)
      - Based on the result of classification model, reduce the quota of each recall path in Ranker for requests predicted to be `Not User-trigger' to reduce computational cost.
